## About Me
So who exactly am I?  I'm 37 years old.  I've been married for 6 years to my beautiful wife. Between the two of us, we have 5 children. I enjoy listening to an album the whole way through. I'll try any meal at least once. I'm a perfectionist (is there really any other way?).  I am also constantly fascinated and amazed at the change, innovation, and creativity that goes into the technology and software development worlds.

This site is my attempt at both creating software that I am trully proud of as well as a way to get more involved. From the code that the website engine runs on to the content you read on each page, it is coded in the open.  You will most likely see typos, I will introduce bugs...and fix them, and at least once, I will probably be embarassed.
