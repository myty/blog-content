I have an admission, confession, or whatever you want to call it...I've lived my adult life in a state of fear.  Fear that I am not good enough.  Fear that I will be a disappointment. Fear that I will fail.  Fear of rejection. Fear so paralyzing, that it keeps me from doing the things I actually want to do.  

I also want to be a part of a developer community that has similar goals and interests as myself.  So how does a fearful wimp get involved in a community?  Obviously, you spend a couple of months working on code to a simple blog engine and then finally get the courage to introduce it to everyone else.

This site (why wouldn't it be) is based on a blog engine that I'm calling, [Muse](http://github.com/myty/muse).  Feel free to check out the code. Fork it. Make it better. Send me your feedback. Hopefully it's good, but I'll take the bad too. Over the next couple of months I will attempt to explain some of the adventures in building Muse.

My wife thinks I'm a genius. I'd say, I'm sufficient at best. This is my way of forcing myself to become a better developer, to get involved, and to reject the notion that I'm not good enough or that I don't belong...and just maybe get closer to the status of genius that my wife thinks I am.

Hello, world. I am Michael Tyson.
